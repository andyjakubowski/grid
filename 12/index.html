          Magnetic compasses have guided sailors for centuries, but a compass
          tells you only in which direction you are pointing, not whereabouts
          you are. A new form of magnetic navigation being developed by the
          United States Air Force Research Laboratory (afrl) can do better. It
          employs magnetometers made from tiny diamonds to indicate an
          aircraft’s precise location over Earth’s surface. It is so accurate
          that it might supersede gps for aerial navigation.
        </p>

        <p>
          A conventional compass aligns with the magnetic field generated by
          convection currents within Earth’s liquid-iron core. This field is,
          itself, approximately aligned with the planet’s axis of spin, and thus
          with the geographical poles. But there are fainter terrestrial
          magnetic fields around as well. These are embedded in the rocks of
          Earth’s crust and have a pattern sufficiently elaborate and
          distinctive as to be unique from place to place. In principle,
          therefore, they can tell you where you are. The trick is to reduce
          that principle to practice.
        </p>

        <p>
          Until recently, the only magnetometers sensitive enough to be useful
          for this task have been costly and bulky. Some also require cooling
          with either liquid helium or liquid nitrogen. None of these things is
          true of a diamond magnetometer.
        </p>

        <p>
          The diamond in question has an atomic lattice containing anomalous
          places called nitrogen-vacancy defects. Diamonds are crystals of
          carbon and these vacancies are places where a carbon atom in the
          crystal lattice has been replaced by a nitrogen atom, and an adjacent
          carbon is missing. When exposed to green laser light such vacancies
          fluoresce. The pattern of fluorescence changes in a magnetic field in
          a way which allows that field’s strength and alignment to be
          determined.
        </p>

        <p>
          Diamond magnetometers are not, in truth, as sensitive as the
          alternatives. But in addition to their cheapness, lack of bulk and
          ability to function at room temperature they also have one further
          advantage. As Michael Slocum, a researcher at afrl who is working on
          the project, observes, other sorts of magnetometers need careful
          calibration—and any system that depends on calibration is likely to
          suffer from measurement drift over the course of time. Since the
          nitrogen defects in a diamond do not move around, no calibration is
          needed.

          Magnetometer-based navigation does require accurate maps of Earth’s
          surface magnetic fields. The best such are made by flying an aircraft
          over the area in question, but if that is not possible then (as the
          picture shows) a satellite can do a reasonable job. Tests suggest that
          navigation of this sort can locate an aircraft’s position to within 13
          metres. And, crucially for military applications (and unlike gps-based
          systems), it is unjammable by the enemy.
        </p>
        <p>
          You are what you eat, the saying goes. It therefore follows that what
          you excrete gives away a lot about you. Writ large, that information
          might yield useful demographic clues about particular neighbourhoods.
          This, at least, is the thinking behind a study by Saer Samanipour of
          the University of Amsterdam, in the Netherlands. Dr Samanipour has
          been analysing sewage, and has shown that it gives a pretty good
          profile of an area’s population.
        </p>
        <p>
          To make sure that his analysis reflected the most up to date
          demographic information Dr Samanipour timed it to coincide with a
          census. The one he chose was that conducted in Australia, in 2016, so
          he called on the assistance of a group of colleagues from the
          University of Queensland.
        </p>

        <p>
          As they describe in a paper in Environmental Science and Technology
          Letters, team members collected samples from more than 100
          sewage-treatment plants for five to seven consecutive days around the
          time of the census. They analysed these for 40 chemicals that past
          research has suggested have socioeconomic significance. Nicotine, for
          example, is associated more with rural populations than urban ones,
          because people living in the countryside are more likely to smoke.
          Caffeine consumption correlates with education levels. Amphetamine use
          tracks levels of crime.
        </p>

        <p>
          In total, the team looked at the concentrations of six legal
          recreational drugs, caffeine and nicotine among them, two illegal
          recreational drugs (amphetamine and methamphetamine), seven opioids
          (the legality of which depends on the circumstances), eight
          antidepressants and antipsychotics, nine other pharmaceuticals, two
          artificial sweeteners and six markers of diet, such as enterolactone,
          a substance that shows how much fibre people are consuming. All of the
          chemical information collected from each treatment plant was paired
          with data from the census to create a model of what the wastewater
          chemistry of populations with particular socioeconomic characteristics
          looks like. Among many correlations detected, the researchers found
          that high levels of b vitamins (abundant in red meat, whole grains and
          dark leafy greens), alcohol and caffeine were associated with
          high-rent districts, generally in the middle of cities, while opioids
          and antidepressants went hand in hand with an abundance of people with
          low-skilled occupations.
        </p>

        <p>
          These general correlations are not, perhaps, that surprising (though
          another, between a lack of internet connection and an antihypertensive
          medication called atenolol, is intriguing—possibly being mediated
          through people’s age). But Dr Samanipour found that in combination
          they could predict quite accurately the demographic make-up of a
          sewage plant’s catchment area. He did this by taking the model he and
          his colleagues had devised, based on their 100 initial plants, and
          applying it to nine others. For each of these they forecasted the
          socioeconomics of the surrounding area and then tested those forecasts
          against reality, as revealed by the census.
        </p>

        <p>
          These forecasts were quite specific: how many people in an area had
          finished secondary school; how many had cars; how many were single
          parents; and so on. Of the 37 questions asked by the census about
          education, occupation, income, social life and housing, the model was
          able to predict the pattern of answers to 30 of them with 25% or less
          deviation from the values calculated by the census.
        </p>

        <p>
          Based on these results the researchers argue that, considering the
          relative ease, low cost and high frequency with which wastewater
          samples can be collected and analysed, their model could profitably be
          used, if not as a replacement for censuses, then at least as a way of
          keeping track of changes in the characteristics of populations more or
          less continuously, as they happen, rather than in a punctuated manner
          every five or ten years.

          Albert einstein was well known for his Gedankenexperimente, or
          “thought experiments”, conducted in imaginary versions of the real
          world. He used them to test ideas that observation could not confirm.
          But it is also possible to do imaginary experiments in worlds which
          are themselves imaginary, and thus to illuminate reality in a novel
          way. This was a particular skill of another 20th-century physicist,
          George Gamow, who explained his subject to the laity via a Mr Tompkins
          and his adventures in alternative wonderlands.
        </p>

        <p>
          In the first of these tales Mr Tompkins dreams of a place where the
          speed of light is about that of a bicycle. How would a cyclist in such
          a world look to a watching pedestrian? Gamow’s answer was that the
          cyclist would shrink from back to front, and the faster he travelled
          the more slowly his pedalling feet would revolve. Gamow’s cyclist is
          compressed by an effect called the Lorentz contraction and his
          pedalling is affected by a slowing of the clock known as time
          dilation. These things are both consequences of the speed of light
          being constant no matter how rapidly its source is approaching or
          receding—an observation that was the starting point for Einstein’s own
          Gedankenexperimente.
        </p>

        <p>
          This, though, turns out to be only part of the story. A paper
          published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society by Evan
          Cryer-Jenkins and Paul Stevenson, of the University of Surrey, in
          Britain, suggests that the full answer is even weirder than Gamow’s
          imaginings.
        </p>

        <p>
          The first modification to Mr Tompkin’s dream came in 1959, two decades
          after his debut. A British mathematician called Roger Penrose
          calculated that he would actually have seen approaching cyclists as
          being elongated along their direction of motion, contracting only as
          they receded. Yet more peculiarly, as they drew abreast of him they
          would appear rotated, as if somehow cycling sideways with their backs
          turned to him. Mr Cryer-Jenkins and Dr Stevenson observe that, in
          addition to all this, the light from Gamow’s cyclists would, from Mr
          Tompkins’s point of view, be Doppler shifted. They also take on board
          a fact which Gamow and Sir Roger (as he now is) did not. Mr Tompkins,
          because he is a human being, has binocular vision.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Doppler effect is a velocity-dependent change in frequency which
          makes light from an approaching object appear bluer than it would were
          its source stationary, and that from a receding object redder. So, not
          only will a cyclist approaching our hero be unfeasibly elongated, he
          will also be blueshifted so far as to be invisibly ultraviolet. He
          will thus appear as a black silhouette looming out of the landscape.
          His apparent distance, however, will fluctuate because, at these
          near-light speeds, the elongated images seen by each eye will warp at
          slightly different moments. Cycling abreast of Mr Tompkins when
          passing him, the rider will suddenly erupt into a pulsating,
          psychedelic rainbow of colour as he moves from blueshift to redshift.
          Amid this light show he will seem to rotate and contract, before
          vanishing into the profound blackness of the infrared—a strange,
          squashed shadow receding into the distance.
