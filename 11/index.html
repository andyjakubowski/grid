        Magnetic compasses have guided sailors for centuries, but a compass
        tells you only in which direction you are pointing, not whereabouts you
        are. A new form of magnetic navigation being developed by the United
        States Air Force Research Laboratory (afrl) can do better. It employs
        magnetometers made from tiny diamonds to indicate an aircraft’s precise
        location over Earth’s surface. It is so accurate that it might supersede
        gps for aerial navigation.

        A conventional compass aligns with the magnetic field generated by
        convection currents within Earth’s liquid-iron core. This field is,
        itself, approximately aligned with the planet’s axis of spin, and thus
        with the geographical poles. But there are fainter terrestrial magnetic
        fields around as well. These are embedded in the rocks of Earth’s crust
        and have a pattern sufficiently elaborate and distinctive as to be
        unique from place to place. In principle, therefore, they can tell you
        where you are. The trick is to reduce that principle to practice.

        Until recently, the only magnetometers sensitive enough to be useful for
        this task have been costly and bulky. Some also require cooling with
        either liquid helium or liquid nitrogen. None of these things is true of
        a diamond magnetometer.

        The diamond in question has an atomic lattice containing anomalous
        places called nitrogen-vacancy defects. Diamonds are crystals of carbon
        and these vacancies are places where a carbon atom in the crystal
        lattice has been replaced by a nitrogen atom, and an adjacent carbon is
        missing. When exposed to green laser light such vacancies fluoresce. The
        pattern of fluorescence changes in a magnetic field in a way which
        allows that field’s strength and alignment to be determined.

        Diamond magnetometers are not, in truth, as sensitive as the
        alternatives. But in addition to their cheapness, lack of bulk and
        ability to function at room temperature they also have one further
        advantage. As Michael Slocum, a researcher at afrl who is working on the
        project, observes, other sorts of magnetometers need careful
        calibration—and any system that depends on calibration is likely to
        suffer from measurement drift over the course of time. Since the
        nitrogen defects in a diamond do not move around, no calibration is
        needed.
